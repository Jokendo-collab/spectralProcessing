# Introduction
This repository contains the information used in pre-processing of the MS/MS spectra and how this can be used to improve the identification of non-human peptides from the raw files.

## Experimental procedure
- [x] Filtering the identified spectra from unidentified spectra; this was accomplished using `Spectra Bioconductor` package.
- [x] Remove low quality and spectra that are non-informative (removing spectra with low Sn/N) ratio. The non-informative spectra were removed by use of pClean bioconductor tool

> Filtering the MS/MS to increase signal to noise ration (S/N)
- [x] Identify human peptides (proteins from the classical analysis); Maxquant sequence search engine using human proteome database downloaded from Uniprot repository
- [x] Identify non-human peptides (proteins); Sample specific construction using metanovo and sequence database search using Maxquant
- [x] **Carry out open modification search (Including both human and non-human protein peptides); Open Search using MSfragger through fragpipe**
- [x] **Identify non-peptide compounds (metabolites) from singuly charged spectra; Extraction of singly charged spectra was done using MSconvert and metabolomics pipeline**
- [x] Re-callibrate the overall assignment rate based on the sum of the above, relative to the total number of high quality non-redudant spectra.
- [x] The clearance of uninformative MS/MS signals was done using pClean [tool](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00141?rand=ztz0p6rs). This was done to remove the low quality and redudant spectra from the RAW files prior to the standard database search.

## Identification of human and non-human peptides
This was done using the MSfragger version (V 3.1.1)

## Open modification searching
- [x] This analysis is done to determine the potential post-translational modifications that could be present in our data.
- [x] We use MSfragger v 3.1.1 for the opem modification searches of the PTMs and the PTMprophet in determining the actual PTMs in our data.
